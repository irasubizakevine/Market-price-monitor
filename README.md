Market Price Monitor is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates the use of core programming concepts such as:

Integers: For performing calculations on prices.

Strings: To generate formatted reports.

Booleans: For logical decision-making based on price thresholds.

Lists: For managing a collection of item names.

Arrays: For fixed-size numeric data handling using Python's array module.

The script calculates key metrics (total, average, minimum, and maximum prices), checks against a defined threshold to assess price standards, and performs basic list manipulations like adding, removing, and sorting items. It also compares sums between a Python list and an array to illustrate their functional similarities.

üìå Features

Calculates:

Total price

Average price

Lowest and highest prices

Applies a threshold to determine if prices are "Above Standard"

Manages an item list (add, remove, sort)

Uses both list and array data structures

Validates data integrity between list and array sums

üìÅ Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries required

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Save the script as market_price_monitor.py

Run it using your Python interpreter:

python market_price_monitor.py

üß† Concepts Demonstrated

Data Types: int, str, bool, list, array

Conditional Logic

Loops & Iteration (optional for expansion)

Data validation

Output formatting using f-strings

üí° Future Improvements

Match items with corresponding prices

Allow user input for dynamic thresholding

Export the report to a .txt or .csv file

Highlight items priced above or below average
